Estimation of the deaths due to tsunami

* This repository was an university project to built up a machine learning model, The first idea came after reading an article form https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/ocean-coasts/tsunamis
* Most of the efforts that have been made were in the preprocessing part. After many personal projects, I tried to write a clean and understandable code and document in a single file, and therefore my work has shaped like an educational work and follows the storytelling approach.
